## Welcome  
Recommended personally by Quantium Health's CEO, the "[Using machine learning and generative AI to improve health outcomes](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/using_machine_learning_and_generative_ai_to_improve_health_outcomes)" 
project allowed our team to investigate trends in issues faced by the Australian population. 
  
The project used scaled multiple linear regression with the user's input data in relation to a government dataset, followed by a connection to OpenAI's API, which then provides the user with generative AI health recommendations based on their submitted form.
